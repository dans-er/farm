Seven top-level MIME types 
hierarchy as defined by IANAâ€™s RFC 
2046 (the eighth type model was added 
later in RFC 2077). Top-level types can 
have subtypes (children), and so on, as 
new media types are defined over the 
years. The use of the multiplicity 
denotes that multiple children may be 
present at the same level in the 
hierarchy, and the ellipses indicate that 
the remainder of the hierarchy has been 
elided in favor of brevity
